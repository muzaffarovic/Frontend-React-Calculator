## Description
The React Calculator Project is a simple and intuitive calculator application built using React, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a clean and responsive interface, allowing users to quickly input numbers, perform calculations, and see results in real time.
## Usage
To use the calculator, simply enter numbers and operators using the calculator buttons. You can clear the current calculation with the 'C' button, and reset the entire calculator with the 'AC' button. The result is displayed in real time as you make calculations.
